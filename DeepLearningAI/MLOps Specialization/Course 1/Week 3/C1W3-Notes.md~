# Data Definition and Baseline

## Learning Objectives

- List the questions you need to answer in the process of data definition.__
- Compare and contrast the types of data problems you need to solve for structured vs. unstructured and big vs. small data.__
- Explain why label consistency is important and how you can improve it__
- Explain why beating human level performance is not always indicative of success of an ML model.__
- Make a case for improving human level performance rather than beating it.__
- Identify how much training data you should gather given time and resource constraints.__
- Describe the key steps in a data pipeline.__
- Compare and contrast the proof of concept vs. production phases on an ML project.__
- Explain the importance of keeping track of data provenance and lineage.__
