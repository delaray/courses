## Selecting and Training a Model

### Modeling Overview

### Key Challenges

AI System = Code + Data

Challenges in Model Development
1. Doing well on training set
2. Doing well on dev/test set
3. Doing well on business metrics/project goals
  
  
### Why Low Average Error Isn't Good Enough

Performance on disproportionately import examples

Informational and Transactional Queries
Navigational Queies


Perfoprmance on Key S;ices of ther Dataset

Example: ML for Loan Approval
- Do no discriminate by ethnicity, gender, location,...

Example: Product Recommendations
- Treat major users, retailers and product categories fairly 

Rare Classes
- Skewed data disdtribution
- Medical domain:
  99% Negative, 1% Positive
  
### Establish a Baseline

- First step: establish a baseline

- Example: Four typer of SR
  - Clear Speech
  - Car Noise
  - People Noise
  - Low Bandwidth
  
- Can use human-level performance vas baseline

- Ways to establish a baseline
  - Human level performance (HLP)
  - Literature Search
  - Quick and Dirty implementation (opewn-source)
  - Performance of an older system

### Tips for Getting Started

- ML is an iterativee process
- First iteration
  - Literature search
  - Don't obsess on SOTA
  - Find Open-source implementastion
  - Reasonable alg with good data better than better alg with worse data
  - Take deployment constraints?
    - Yes if baseline established and goal is deployment
	- No if goal is to establish a baselinew
	
- Snaity-check for code and algorithm
  - Try to overfit a on small dsataset before moving to larger one
