# Week 2: Feature Engineering Transformation and Selection

Implement feature engineering, transformation, and selection with TensorFlow Extended by encoding structured and unstructured data types and addressing class imbalances  

## Learning Objectives  

- Define a set of feature engineering techniques, such as scaling and binning
- Use TensorFlow Transform for a simple preprocessing and data transformation task
- Describe feature space coverage and implement different feature selection methods
- Perform feature selection using scikit-learn routines and ensure feature space coverage
