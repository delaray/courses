# Week 5: Interpretability

Learn about model interpretability - the key to explaining your modelâ€™s inner workings to laypeople and expert audiences and how it promotes fairness and helps address regulatory and legal requirements for different use cases.  

## Learning Objectives  

- Deconstruct a model to understand and explain how it is making predictions
- Determine tools to make your models explainable to yourself and others in easy to understand terms
- Provide mechanisms to address model fairness and compliance with regulatory requirements
- Differentiate and compare different methods to extract interpretation of models by introspection or explanation
- Distinguish between multiple available techniques such as: Partial Dependance Plots, SHAP and LIME; to provide insight into how model predictions are actually made
- Use cloud managed service for AI explanations
