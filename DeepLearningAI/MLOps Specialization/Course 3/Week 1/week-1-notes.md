# Week 1 Neural Architecture Search  

Learn how to effectively search for the best model that will scale for various serving needs while constraining model complexity and hardware requirements.  

## Learning Objectives  

- Recognize the cases where Neural Architecture Search is the appropriate tool to find the right model architecture.
- Distinguish between trainable parameters and hyperparameters
- Judge when manual parameter search does not scale well
- Identify search spaces and summarize the best strategies to navigate this space to find optimal architectures.
- Differentiate the advantages and disadvantages AutoML for different use cases
- Carry out different metric calculations to assess AutoML efficacy
- Identify some cloud AutoML offerings and recognize their strengths and weaknesses
