# Week 3: High-Performance Modeling  


Implement distributed processing and parallelism techniques to make the most of your computational resources for training your models efficiently.  

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the rise in computational requirements with current network architectures
- Select techniques to optimize the usage of computational resources to best serve your model needs
- Carry out high-performance data ingestion to reduce hardware accelerators idling time
- Distinguish between data and model parallelism to train your models in the most efficient way
- Implement knowledge distillation to reduce models that capture complex relationships among features so that they fit in constrained deployment environments
