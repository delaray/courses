# Week 4: Model Analysis  


Use model performance analysis to debug and remediate your model and measure robustness, fairness, and stability.  

## Learning Objectives  

- Determine and analyze model performance through metric based black box evaluation
- Carry out model introspection to reflect on how different components of a model affect performance
- Integrate TensorFlow Model Analysis to your production pipeline
- Use different slices of data to gain further insight on your models pitfalls and shortcomings
- Establish tools and analysis to fix and debug your models
- Determine how to monitor and protect your models against random and adversarial attacks
- Check model fairness and evaluate model performance against commonly used fairness metrics
- Provide ways to continuously evaluate and monitor your models in production for ensuring stable performance of ML applications
