Build the vocabulary by extracting each unique word that appears.

Sparse Representation
For each tweet build a vector same size as vocabulary with a 1 if word appear or a zero otherwise.  
This is known as a sparse respresentation.

Problems with sparse representration. 
- Would have to learn n parameters theta, where n = |V|
- Large training time
- Large prediction time

## Negative and Positive Frequencies  

Generate word counts for positive and negative classes.
Frequency dictionary m,aps aa word and its class to a count.
