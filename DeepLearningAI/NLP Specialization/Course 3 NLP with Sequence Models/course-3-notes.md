# Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models  

In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:  

a) Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets.  
b) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model.  
c) Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers.  
d) Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.  
  
  
## Week 1: Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis

Learn about neural networks for deep learning, then build a sophisticated tweet classifier that places tweets into positive or negative sentiment categories using a deep neural network.

## Week 2: Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling

Learn about the limitations of traditional language models and see how RNNs and GRUs use sequential data for text prediction. Then build your own next-word generator using a simple RNN on Shakespeare text data.  
  
  
----
  

## Week 3: LSTMs and Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Learn how long short-term memory units (LSTMs) solve the vanishing gradient problem and how Named Entity Recognition systems quickly extract essential information from text. Then build your own Named Entity Recognition system using an LSTM and data from Kaggle.  
  
  
----
  
  
## Week 4: Siamese Networks

Learn about Siamese networks, a special type of neural network made of two identical networks that are eventually merged, then build your own Siamese network that identifies question duplicates in a dataset from Quora.
