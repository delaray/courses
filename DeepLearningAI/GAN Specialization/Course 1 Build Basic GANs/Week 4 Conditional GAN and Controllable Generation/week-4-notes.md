# Conditional GAN and Controllable Generation

Understand how to effectively control your GAN, modify the features in a generated image, and build conditional GANs capable of generating examples from determined categories!  

## Learning Objectives

- Control GAN generated outputs by adding conditional inputs.
- Control GAN generated outputs by manipulating z-vectors.
- Be able to explain disentanglement in a GAN.
