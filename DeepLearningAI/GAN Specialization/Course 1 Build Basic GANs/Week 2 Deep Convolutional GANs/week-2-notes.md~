# Week 2: Deep Convolutional GANs  

Learn about different activation functions, batch normalization, and transposed convolutions to tune your GAN architecture and apply them to build an advanced DCGAN specifically for processing images!  

## Learning Objectives  

- Be able to explain the components of a Deep Convolutional GAN.  
- Compose a Deep Convolutional GAN using these components.  
- Examine the difference between upsampling and transposed convolutions.
