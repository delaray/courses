# Introduction to Prototyping GenAI Applications with Streamlit


## The Prototyping Development Cycle


## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Over-engineering
- Don't ask AI to build all at once
- GennAI works best when task is well-pdefined
- Optimizing wothoput validating
- Buildiong without a plan to scale
- Prototypes are meant to be disposible
