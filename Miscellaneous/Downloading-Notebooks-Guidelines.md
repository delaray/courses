2. Click File → Open... , this will open your workspace.

3. On the top right, click Lab Files , this will open a panel.

4. Now, you can either download the entire workspace by clicking Download all files or you can select the files you want to download.

## Refreshing your Workspace
  
This will come in handy whenever you need to start from scratch, fetch the latest version of the assignment, or run into a 404 error.

1. Open the notebook from the classroom.

2. After the notebook opens up, click File → Open

3. When your workspace opens, tick the check box before your notebook file. After it is selected, press Shutdown. The icon beside the filename should turn from green to gray.

4. Tick the checkbox again and this time choose Rename and enter any filename other than the original. For example, C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb (original) → C1_W1_Assignment_v2.ipynb

5. (Optional) Tick the checkbox of any other file that you want to get a fresh copy of (e.g. dataset files that you might have manipulated irreversibly). Then click  Delete . You can also opt to Rename or Download each file individually in case you want to keep them before deleting.

6. Click on the Help button on the top right of the page.

7. Click the Get latest version button.

8. Click the Update Lab button. The page will refresh and you should now see the latest version of the notebook.__
