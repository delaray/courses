# Module 2: Information Retrieval and Search Foundations

## Module 2 introduction

Needs to match user prompt to wide range of documnets quickly


## Retriever architecture overview

Two search approaches
- Keyword Search
- Semantic search
Known as hybrid search

Each search typically returns 20 - 50 docs
Many docs may be common to both
Ranking may differ
Each list sent to metadata filter
The filtered lists then combined and ranked

- Keyword search: Ensures sensitivity to users words
- Semantic search: Ensures docs relevant to proimpt included
- Metadata filtering: Exclude docs based on rigid criteria
Need to balance these 3 techniques to meet users needs


## Metadata filtering

Uses rigid criterria
Used to narrow dfown retrieval
  
PROS
- Conceptually simple
- Fast, optimized, mature & reliable
- Enfoorces strict matching rules

CONS
- Not true search
- Content ignored so no way to rank
- Useless alone

Needs to be paired with other techniques

## Keyword search - TF-IDF

- Powered retrieval for decades
- Prompt & Keywords treated as Bag of Words
- Uses sparse vectors (vector of full vocab)
- A vector isd generated for each doc
- Arranged in a matrix: 
  - **Term Documenmt Matrix**
  - Rows are words
  - Columns are documents
  - Also referred to as **Inverted Index**
  
- Simple scoring: 1 point per word
- Frequency scorting: n points per word
- IDF scoring: # of docs word appears in / total docs
- Generate TF-IDF matrix by muliplying TF matrix by IDF matrix element-wise
- Constituites standard baseline for document retrieval
- Modern systems use a refined version of TF-IDF called BM25

## Keyword search - BM25

Best Matching 25 (BM25)
- BM25 is a scoring function 
- Improves on classic TF-IDF
- The 25 refers to the 25th variant of scoring algorithms tested
- Standard keyw3ord search technique used in RAG retrievers
- Gives the score for a single keyword in a singlew document

Improves TF-IDF in several ways
- **Term Frequency Saturation**
  - Discounts keyword appearance as frequency increases
  - Keyword appearing 20 times not twice as relevant as one  appearing 10 times
- **Documnt Length Normalization*U*
  - TF-IDF overally penalizes long documents
  - BM25 applies diminishing additional penalties as do size increases
  
- BM25 includes 2 tunable hyperparameters
  - k: Controls how much term frequency influences score
    - Higher value increase impact of TFC
	- Lower values reduce it
  -h: Controls degree of normalization for doc length
    - Balances favoring longer vs shorter docs
	
- MB25 vs. TF-IDF
  - better performance
  - same cost
  - more flexibility
  
Keyword Search Overview
  - Strengths
    - Convert keywords to sparse vectors
    - Simplicitly
    - Ensures exact keyword matching
  - Weaknesses
    - Depends on keyword appearing in prompt
    


## Semantic search - introduction

## Semantic search - embedding model deepdive

- Use millions of positive and negative pair examples
- Contrastive Training Process
- Use three inputs: anchor, pos example, negative example

Key takeaways
- Semantic vectors are abstract and somewhat random
- Before training location ion space has no meaning
- After training locations have meaning
- Clusters of similar text has formed
- Only compare vectors from same embedding model

## LAB: Vector embeddings in RAG 

In the context of RAG, vector embeddings are used for:  

- Powering Search:  

Capturing Meaning: Vector embeddings act like a map for text. They convert words and sentences into positions in vector space that capture meaning. These vectors can then be used to locate information matching a query.  
Comparing Similarity: When a prompt is received, it is converted into an embedding vector of its own. Then, the similarity between this prompt's vector and other vectors in the database can be calculated. This helps identify texts closest in meaning to the prompt.  
  
Understanding Context:  

Context Matters: They help in understanding the context of words in a query, ensuring that the best-matched information is found.  
Flexibility: Contextual embeddings allow for adapting to different meanings and capturing details that might otherwise be overlooked.  

In essence, vector embeddings are a behind-the-scenes technology that facilitates smarter, more helpful, and accurate data retrieval by capturing nuances in a way that no other search technique provides.  
  

## Hybrid search

- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)  
- Beta hyperparameter  
  - provide weighting between Semantic vs Keyword  
  - 70/30 is a good starting point

Allows Retriever to take advantage of all 3 search strastegies:  
- Metadata filtering  
- Keyword Search  
- Semantic Search  
  
  
## Evaluating retrieval

Precision = Total retrieved / Total documents
Recall = Total retreieved / Total relevant

Precision pernalizes for returning irrelevant documents
Recall penalizes for leavfing out relevant documents

Mean Average Precision (MAP): Good indicator of average precision

Reciprocal Rank
- 1/rank
- Mean Reciprical Rank
