# GCP Infrastructure Scaling & Automation

# Module 1: Introduction

## Welcome to Elastic Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation

Welcome to Elastic Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation. The lecture
you just watched focused on three architecting courses. These courses
introduce you to the comprehensive and flexible infrastructure and
platform services provided by Google Cloud, with a focus on Compute Engine:

1. Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation
2. Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services
3. Elastic Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation (this course)

This course builds on the Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services 
course and enhances your study of architecting with Compute Engine. 

In this course, we start by going over the different options to interconnect 
networks to enable you to connect your infrastructure to Google Cloud. 

Next, we’ll go over Google Cloud’s load balancing and autoscaling services,
which you will get to explore directly. 

Then, we’ll cover infrastructure automation services like Terraform, so that you can automate the deployment of Google Cloud infrastructure services. Lastly, we’ll talk about other managed services that you might want to leverage in Google Cloud. Here are the modules of the course: 

1. Interconnecting Networks
2. Load Balancing and Autoscaling
3. Infrastructure Automation
4. Managed Services
