# Advanced Multi-Agent AI System

## Module 1: Multi-Agent System Architecture and Design Priciples 


### Dialogue: The Autonomous Supply Chain

- Agent Coordination Protocols:
  - How to prevent overreactions while allowing rapid responses.
  
- Decision Rights and Boundaries:
  - Defining when agents coordinate, escalate, or act independently.
  
- Governance Framework: 
  - Monitoring, auditing, and overriding agent decisions.
  
- Balancing Autonomy and Accountability:
  - Designing for speed and risk management.
  
- Safeguards for Emergent Behaviors:
  Addressing unintended system-level outcomes.


### Introduction

- Explore architectural patterns for effective agent collaboration
- Design governance frameworks to ensure safety and alignment
- Build adaptable multi-agent prototypes for real applications


### Understanding Multi-Agent System Fundamentals

- Difference between parallel & collaboarative agents
- Analyze how specialization & coordination drive MA Coordination
- Evaluate real-world applications of multi-agent systems

- Agentic AI Market growth
  - 56.1% CAGR
  - $10.4B by 2025

- Multi-Agent System
  - Specializaed agents instead of one generalist
  
- Three Core Capabilities
  - Coordination
  - Specialization
  - Communication
  
- Anthropic Multi-Agent Research System
  - Specialized agents work in parallel
  - Share findings via structured communication
  - Produce coherent research outputs
  
  
### Multi-Agent System Architectures and Topologies

- How should agents coordinate and communicate

- Objectives
  - Differentiate between centralized, decentralize and hierarchical architectures
  - Analyse how architectural choices affedct coordination, scalability & governance
  - Evalaluate which architectural pattern best fits requirements  
  - No one-size fits all
  
- Centralized System 
  - Single supervisor
  - Tight coordination and centralkized cointrol
  - Financial Industry

- Decentralized System 
  - Agents communicate peer-to-peer
  - Open ended environments
  - Rese

- Hierarchical System 
  - Enterprise systems
  - Balance autonomy with centralized system
  - 

- Summary
  - Centralized: Tight control via supervision
  - Decentralized Flexiblee peer-to-peer collaboaration
  - Hierarchical: Structure and scalable design 
  - Architecture: Shapes behaviuor, performance & governance

  
### Agent Role Definition and Specialization Strategies

Netflix & Spotify have built MA recommentation systemms
- Clear agent roles defined
- Enabling these specialized agents to work together effectively
- Requires designing communication protocols that balance structure with flexibility
- Share critical information and maintain autonomous decision-making capabilities
 
 
### Communication Protocols and Memory Sharing

Depends on three key aspects
- Clear Protocols
  - Clear, consistent message protocols
- Vocabularies
  - Shared vocabularuies for semantic understanding
- Memory
  - Memory systems enabling knowledge sharing
  
Example: ANTHROP\C Research system

#### Agent
- Agent finds relevant paper
- Extracts structured metadata
- Shares metadata with other agents

#### Collective Thinking
- Storing Data:
  - Deposit individual insights, partial results and context
- Building upon:
  - Enable other other agents to build on it
  
### Memory Architecture
- Shared mermory space
- Frameworls like Crewai & Langraph have facilities for shared memory
